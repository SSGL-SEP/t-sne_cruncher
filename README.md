# Audio analyzer for [Speech explorer](https://github.com/SSGL-SEP/speech_explorer)

Typically reads data from .wav files and outputs json data used by [Speech explorer](https://github.com/SSGL-SEP/speech_explorer)

## Usage

For best results use python 3.6 or newer. Fingerprinting will work on any python 3 system but the tag order in the json file will be undefined and some features in the tests will not work.

Run with `python3 cruncher.py -h` to see help.
